## Login Page V1

My goal is to get a functioning login page.
For that, I'm going to need to get the MongoDB bit of this set up.

This will contain the user profile information (as well as watchlist, currently watching, ratings, and admin setup)
With Tauri, I'll need it to complete the login page in Vue (hoping to create a little steam-me-up-scotty logo),
and Rust will be used to connect to the MongoDB database to validate authorization.
