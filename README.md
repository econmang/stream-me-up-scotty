## Introduction
There are so many streaming services available today. Some are really neat and have a lot to offer... other have issues of only having a limited set of options of interest,
but to get those, you have to add their subscription to your monthly bills. 

This application is meant to help avoid those additional costs. The goal is have this be a streaming application to be used against a home media server.
Users could pay a one-time cost of the digital media and then avoid a subscription cost beyond that point.

They could store their library on a PC and then use this interface to create profiles, watchlists, etc. against that personal library.

## Technologies
This is just a rough outline, so I'm still trying to determine the stack. I would like to use Rust. If the interface becomes web-oriented or is deployed as a service
as opposed to a local application, I'm hoping to incorporate WASM.
